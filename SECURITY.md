If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately using one of the methods below:

### Preferred Methods

1. **GitHub Security Advisory** (Recommended)
   - Go to our [Security Advisories page](https://github.com/yourusername/AdventureNexus/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with detailed information

2. **Email Report**
   - Send details to: **security@adventurenexus.com**
   - Use PGP key if available: [Public Key Link]
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide the following information to help us understand and reproduce the issue:

```
**Vulnerability Type:** (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, Authentication Bypass)
**Affected Component:** (e.g., Frontend, API, Authentication)
**Severity:** (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
**Description:** Brief description of the vulnerability
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

**Expected Behavior:** What should happen
**Actual Behavior:** What actually happens
**Impact:** Potential security impact
**Proof of Concept:** (Screenshots, code snippets, etc.)
**Suggested Fix:** (Optional) Your recommendations
**Environment:**
- OS: 
- Browser: 
- Version: 
- Other relevant details:
```

## Response Timeline

We are committed to responding quickly to security reports:

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **24 hours** | Initial acknowledgment of your report |
| **72 hours** | Preliminary assessment and severity rating |
| **7 days** | Detailed response with timeline for fix |
| **30 days** | Target resolution for most issues |

### Severity Levels

- **üî¥ Critical**: Immediate threat to user data or system integrity
- **üü† High**: Significant security risk requiring urgent attention  
- **üü° Medium**: Moderate security risk with reasonable timeline
- **üü¢ Low**: Minor security concern with flexible timeline

## Security Measures

### Current Security Implementations

- **üîê Authentication**: Clerk-based secure authentication
- **üõ°Ô∏è Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **üîí Data Encryption**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **üìä Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **üö´ SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries with Mongoose
- **üîç Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **üìù Audit Logging**: Security event logging and monitoring

### Dependencies Security

We regularly update our dependencies and use automated tools to detect vulnerabilities:

```
# Frontend security auditing
npm audit --audit-level high

# Backend security scanning  
npm audit fix --force
```

### Environment Security

- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Secure session management
- CORS properly configured
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input sanitization and validation

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security Guidelines

1. **üîí Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, tokens)
2. **‚úÖ Validate all inputs** on both client and server side
3. **üõ°Ô∏è Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
4. **üîê Implement proper authentication** for protected routes
5. **üìù Log security events** for monitoring and incident response

### Secure Development Practices

```
// ‚úÖ Good: Proper input validation
app.post('/api/users', validate(userSchema), async (req, res) => {
  // Validated input processing
});

// ‚ùå Bad: No validation
app.post('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  // Direct processing without validation
});
```

### Environment Variables

Always use environment variables for sensitive data:

```
# ‚úÖ Good
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/adventurenexus
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key

# ‚ùå Bad - Never hardcode in source
const dbUrl = "mongodb://localhost:27017/adventurenexus";
```

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

### Our Commitment

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the reported issue
3. **Communication**: We will keep you informed of our progress
4. **Resolution**: We will work to resolve the issue promptly
5. **Recognition**: With your permission, we will acknowledge your contribution

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- **30 days** minimum before any public disclosure
- **90 days** maximum timeline for resolution
- **Mutual agreement** on disclosure timing
- **Security advisory** published after fix is deployed

## Security Resources

### For Security Researchers

- **Bug Bounty**: Currently not available (volunteer project)
- **Hall of Fame**: Recognition for responsible disclosure
- **Direct Contact**: security@adventurenexus.com

### For Users

- **Security Updates**: Subscribe to our releases for security patches
- **Best Practices**: Follow our deployment security guidelines
- **Incident Response**: Report suspicious activity immediately

## Security Hardening Recommendations

### For Self-Hosted Deployments

```
# 1. Keep dependencies updated
npm audit fix

# 2. Use HTTPS only
# Configure reverse proxy (nginx/apache) with SSL

# 3. Secure environment variables  
# Use tools like docker-secrets or HashiCorp Vault

# 4. Enable security headers
# Configure CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.

# 5. Regular backups
# Automated encrypted backups of user data
```

### Database Security

- Use MongoDB Atlas for managed security
- Enable authentication and authorization
- Use connection string with authentication
- Regular security patches and updates
- Network security (VPC, firewall rules)

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Assess scope and impact
   - Contain the issue if possible
   - Document all findings

2. **Communication**:
   - Internal team notification
   - User notification if data is involved
   - Regulatory compliance if required

3. **Resolution**:
   - Deploy security fixes
   - Verify fix effectiveness
   - Post-incident review

## Legal
